# DRL-Practice-1
A "hello world" DRL implementation, based on the Gymnasium.

1, Run hello_world.py to see a random action agent. 

2, Run train_agent0.py to train the agent using DQN. 

3, Run eval_agent0.py to enjoy the model. 

Notice, the program eval_agent0.py has selected the best model parameters. If the seed() function in train_agent0.py is changed, the optimal model needs to be manually selected according to the training results.
